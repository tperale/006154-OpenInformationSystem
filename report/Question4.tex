4. Explain how you modiﬁed your conceptual schema and ontologies in order to adapt your system to the Good Relations standard and ensure consistency?
In order to adapt the system to the Good Relations standard and ensure the consistency we select three different classes of this standard, explained below. in which we didn’t have to modify a lot our conceptual schema and ontologies, so with ensure our consistency by just adding this classes and connecting them to the ones that already exist, which are eBook and Purchase(explained below).
Good Relation standard added to the existing classes:
ProductOrService where it two subclasses, eBook that will be a product of our webapp and also a Good Relations subclass named ProductOrServiceInstance which will have instances of the products of the webapp .
DeliveryMethod was also chosen and is a subclass of the Purchase class of our webapp, to ensure that the only delivery method we have is through Direct Download as mentioned in this standard.
PaymentMethod was also added as a subclass of Purchase, to have an standard method when the customer is buying a Product and also a subclass to ensure that our payments methods will be only by credit card.
